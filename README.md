## Antreas Antoniou

I am a Machine Learning Research Associate at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Amos Storkey. I am a member of the BayesWatch research group and the Adaptive and Neural Computation (ANC) research institute. 

Leading my research interests is Multi-Modal Learning, specifically targeting the synergistic integration of text, images, audio, and video data. This is followed by the development of Self-Supervised Methods, inspired by mechanisms of infant learning and principles of evolutionary computation.

Additional key areas include Meta-Learning, Adversarial Learning, and Optimization Techniques Inspired by Evolutionary Optimization. These are applied across both differentiable and gradient-free optimization paradigms. Other relevant research dimensions include Inductive Biases, Scalability, Computational Efficiency, and Memory-Augmented Neural Networks.
